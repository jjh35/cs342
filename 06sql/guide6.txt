As in the last unit, work through the following materials writing one sample query for each mechanism using the modified version of the movies database (see code/06sql/guide06.sql).

Advanced SQL (Section 7.1, continued) — Write sample queries that:

Implement an inner join (Section 7.1.6).
Select performerId
From (Casting JOIN MOVIE ON id = movie)
WHERE Dname = 'star';

Implement an outer join (Section 7.1.6).
select P.firstName AS Performer_name, S.Lname AS Supervisor_name
	From (Performer AS P LEFT OUTER JOIN Casting AS C ON P.id = C.performerId);
Use an aggregate function (Section 7.1.7).
select SUM(year), MAX(year)
	From Movie;

Use grouping (Section 7.1.8).
Select title, score
	From Movie 
	Group BY year;
