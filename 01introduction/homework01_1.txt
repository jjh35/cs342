Jesse Hulse, Homework 1
Exercise 1.14
a. The Major collum in the Student table needs to be changed.
The Department and the Course_number columns in the COURSE table would need to be updated. 
The Course_number colunm in the SECTION table would need to be updated.
Both the Course_number and Preerquisite_number would need to be updated in the PREREQUISITE table.
b.In the COURSE table, one could drop the department column because the department information is clear in the 
course_number column. If one made the Course_number the primary key in the COURSE table and
made the Course_number columns in the SECTION and PREREQUISITE tables be forign keys, then if one uses
ON UPDATE CASCADE when creating the SECTION and PREREQUISITE tables, these columns will be updated when 
the Course_number is updated in the COURSE table.
C. the same solution as above applies for only changing one field.
