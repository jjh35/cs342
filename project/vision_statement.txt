I built a database of soccer players. It will have a different table for each major European league. A user can create a team of soccer
players and join a league. Each team in the league will compete against each other in a weekly match up. The players stats will come from the 
actual players stats in their respective leagues.

This database will allow users to build teams based on player position, and will let users create  leagues to compete in.
The database will keep track of matchups and scores. This setup is different than current fantasy soccer websites because
my database allows for players to be picked from different leagues accross the world. 

I implimented a restful web service that allows a user to view their team's information, update their team, create a new team, or delete their team.

A nosql kvlite database was added for fast querying for when (if) the sql tables become very large.
