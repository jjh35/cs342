I want to build a database of soccer players. It will have a different table for each major European league. I would hope
to build a web scraper to fill the Database. The user interface will allow one to generate facts and statistics about
the different players and teams. Ultimately,it will be able to create stats that will help me create my fantasy soccer
teams, but this would take a lot of work to build the web scraper and write methods to generate the statistics.

This database will allow users to build teams based on player position, and will let users create mock leagues to compete in.
The database will keep track of matchups and scores. This setup is different than current fantasy soccer websites because
my database allows for players to be picked from different leagues accross the world.  I will also allow user to trade 
players, which current fanstasy soccer websites do not allow.
