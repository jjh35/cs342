Work through the following materials writing one sample query for each mechanism. Use this modified version of the movies database as the basis for your queries.

Basic SQL (Section 6.3) — Review basic SQL as needed, then write sample queries that:

Use one or more tuple variables (Section 6.3.2).
Select P.firstName, S.LastName 
From  Performer AS P, Performer As S
Where P.firstName = S.lastName; 

Use one or more of the set operations, e.g., UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT (Section 6.3.4).
SELECT  firstName, LastName
     FROM Performer
     Where firstName = "John"
EXCEPT
     SELECT  LastName
     FROM Perfromer
     Where lastName = "Smith;


Advanced SQL (Sections 7.1.1–7.1.5) — This will include more new material; write sample queries that:

Select based on a NULL field value (Section 7.1.1).
SELECT LastName
     FROM Performer
     Where firstName IS NULL;

Implement a nested sub-query, using [NOT] EXISTS, IN, ANY or ALL (Sections 7.1.2–7.1.4).
SELECT firstName, LastName
From Performe 
Where id IN
	(Select performerID
	From Castring
	Where status = 'star');

Implement a correlated sub-query (Section 7.1.3).

SELECT M.title, P.firstName, P.lastName
From Performer as P, Movie as M
Where P.firstName = M.title OR P.lastName = M.title;
