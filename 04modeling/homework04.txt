Jesse Hulse, Homework 4

Exercise 14.31
A.
The relation is in 1st nornmal form because the rows are atomic values, not comma seperated lists
Proof: I will show that the relation is not in BCNF 
Step 1: Identify functional dependencies and show that the LHS is a superkey.
As the book states: Book_title -> Publisher, Book_type
Book_type -> List_price, and Author_name -> Author_affil
Unfortunately, Book_type is not a canidate key because many books can of the same type can have a the same List_price.
Thus this relation is not in BCNF.

I will show that this relation is not in 4NF. Since 4NF is a subset of BCNF, then this relation is not part of 4NF
because it is not part of BCNF
B. Since the relation is not in BCNF, then breaking the relation into multiple relations will help to clean up the schema.
   We can have the following 3 relations
   1. Book(Book_title, Publisher, Book_Type_ID, Author_name)
      Now, the only functional dependancey is Book_title, Author_name -> Publisher, Book_Type. Since Book_title, Auhor_name is a canidate key
      then this relation is now in BCNF. Book_Type_ID and Author_name are foreign keys to the following 2 tables.
   2. Book_Type(ID, List_price)
      The only functional Dependancy is ID -> List_price and ID is a canidate key, so we are in BCNF
   3. Author(Author_name, Author_affil)
       Author_name->author_afil  is the only FD, and Author_name is a canidate key, so we are in BCNF


Exercise 14.35 
Book_name, edition -> year, but not vice-versa. (year ->> Book_name, edition)
The title and coauthor names stay the same from edition to edition.
A. (Author, Edition) is a canidate key
   (Author, Copyright_Year) is a canidate
B. Since different tuples that have the same Book_name and Author will be just different editions of the same book, then it multi-value determines the edtion and year.
   (We are told to assume that The title and coauthor names stay the same from edition to edition)
   Book, Edition, and Year will functionally determine Author, so the MVD {Book} -> {Author} | {Edition, Year}
C. The two relations we would want would be:
   Book(Book_name, Author, Edition);
   Edition(Edition, Year); 

   The Book relations in in BCNF as shown (all values are atomic, so we are in 1NF)
   1. The only functional dependancy is the trivial one
   2. Thus all three columns are the canidate key
   3. The trivial FD will have the canidate key on the LFS
   Thus Book is in BCNF. There is no multivalued FDs other than the trivial one, so it is in 4NF

   The Edition relation in in 1NF (all values are atomic) and in BCNF as shown
   1. Edition -> year 
   2. Edition is a canidate key.
   3. The LHS of the functional Dependency is the canidate key, so we are in BCNF
    There is no multivalued FDs other than the trivial one, so it is in 4NF
