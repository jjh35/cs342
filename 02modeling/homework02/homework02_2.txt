2. Exercise 5.20 
	a. If CIT wanted to replace surrogates student ID numbers with a more natural number, then a student's full name would be a natural first
	suggestion. But names are not always unique, so if two students had the same name, there would be problems.  A completely natural 
	identifier that is unqiue for each and every student that might attend Calvin will be extremley difficult to find. So, surrogate keys
	are a solution that is easy to impliment and always gurantees uniqueness.
